# Silicon_Valley
## Overview
This project was [Inspired](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACmydtFDTGs) by a scene in Silicon Valley; Jin Yang created a Logistic Classifier that takes images as input and returns a boolean value of hotdog and not hotdog. To expand upon this idea I figured we could take an image as input and output a percentage for how likely it is each train group; The maxmimum predicted value is most similar group- basically a linear model

### Purpose
Using Beautiful Soup scrape a folder of images for each produce item, then train a neural network and classify new images. Tensorflow has a built in library that allows us to preprocess images for machine learning
